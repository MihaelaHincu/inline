            <p>My name is Mihaela and at the moment, I am junior front end developer (with aspirations for full stack).
                This passion started to bloom 2 years ago.</p>
            <p>I come from a little city called Constanta, which is in Romania. Curently, I'm living in Bucharest. I
                like to create something beautiful looking, using my imagination but as much as I try to balance
                everything, I prefer functionality over estetics.</p>
            <p>Other things that I keep close to my heart are chill walks, running and cooking with way too many
                spices(what's the ballance between enough pepper and way too much? I don't know!)</p>
            <p>Now that you know something about me, you can view my <a href="#" class="btn nav-btn"

            <p>My education is..a long story</p>
            <!-- <p>As a background, I am a Communication&PR university drop-out. I dropped out because I didn't want to own a bachelor's degree wich didn't make me feel proud or happy. You can't just learn something and never use it, therefore I keep the knowledge obtained from university close to my heart, since I did invest in the time I spent there, before deciding that I want to take a different career path. I didn't know my career path from the start, life has its ups and downs. When I found the "courage" to write my first plain HTML.. it was all it was needed to spark my curiosity. I didn't know from the start that this path will be THIS challenging, but that's the fun in all of it, somehow.. there's nothing more satisfying than finding one of the possible ways of exterminating bugs, or creating a webpage with a polished design.
                </p> -->
            <p>
                <!-- In other words,  -->I could say that I've chosen the much harder route of self-education, as it has
                always fit me better anyway. I don't think I would do well in the college format of learning. I prefer
                to dive deep into one thing, rather than spread my learning out across multiple subjects at once. I'm
                the type that circles back and fills in the blanks when they become relevant to what I'm doing. I like
                to enroll in informal courses. For me, the certifications I achieve out of the courses represent:
                dedication, hard work, and perseverance, because to me they weren't easy. They required me to plan and
                see the big picture.
                <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why it makes me so happy to create something out of thin
                <del>air</del> keys, but it does, and I love it.</p>

            <br>
            <p> IT all began with a course which put the base of my<a class="btn " target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.digitalskills.ro/cursuri/web-design">html&css</a> knowledge, a few things I
                learned about are:
                <ul>
                    <li> CSS “box model” and the layout components that it consists of</li>
                    <li> Bootstrap Grid System</li>
                    <li> meta tags in HTML</li>
                    <li> HTML5 structure</li>
                    <li> onepage website format</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The final exam consisted of a presentation of a self-made one-page website. It concluded with an ANC
                    accreditation for "webpages designer".</p>
            </p>

            <br>
            <p> After that I wanted something a little bit more challenging, therefore I enrolled at the <a class="btn"
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://scoalainformala.ro/program/web-dev-javascript-bucuresti/curriculum/curriculum/"> "Web
                    Development(Javascript)" </a>course from "Scoala Informala de IT". Everything felt more in-depth,
                from being accepted to the course, to the intensive learning and the final exam, project & presentation.
                After all the white hairs that javascript gave me, I graduated with another ANC certificate this time
                for "developer help(ajutor de programator)"; a few things to which I was introduced are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Coercion, scope & callback in JavaScript</li>
                    <li>IIFEs </li>
                    <li>AJAX requests</li>
                    <li>JSON</li>
                    <li>Firebase: realtime database</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <p>In the future I want to finish a few more courses: PHP, Phyton, Angular6, MySQL & anything interesting
                that will appear in the future. And maybe attend a <a class="btn" target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.ucn.dk/english/programmes-and-courses/web-development"> univeristy in Denmark</a>,
                because I know that certifications don't serve as a replacement for a college degree. You don't need a
                college degree to become a developer, but it never hurts to have one.
                I want to swim in diplomas and maybe I'll eventually dye my hair gray from all the sleepless nights I'll
                have from learning how to be a better coder. </p>
            <p>Until that day comes, I'm just a junior with a hunger for knowledge, a little bit naive but extremely
                dedicated. :)</p>

        <div class="projects-page content-wrapper">
            <p>Here you will find my most recent projects.</p>
            <p>My last project was a<a href="https://mihaelahincu.github.io/Restaurant/" class="btn">Restaurant
                    website</a>.I keep this website close to my heart. I tried many things with this project, from the
                theme to the way I wrote the code. I took my time and updated it constantly, every time I learned
                something new. This project is my lab-rat, at the moment, it's a bit sloppy. I have a few things in my
                mind which I'd like to implement.
            </p>
            <p>The other project i want to tell you about is <a
                    href="https://mihaelahincu.github.io/Projects/BabyBear/index.html " class="btn">"BabyBear"
                    website</a>. This virtual shop was built with the idea of selling a variety of items, and it's
                also the final project for the Web Development course. This is my very first project wich uses
                javascript, it's not very detailed, but I think it's a good way of measuring my progress. I feel proud
                of it now, but in a few years, I'll laugh about the code I wrote. Learning to code, one project at a
                time!</p>
            <p>And the last project is <a href="https://mihaelahincu.github.io/flowershop/index.html" class="btn">A
                    flowershop website</a>This is my first Vue.js project, it was a joy to learn my first framework. I
                used a basic html&css base, and modified it with vue's particularities.</p>
