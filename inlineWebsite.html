                <p>My name is Mihaela and at the moment, I am junior front end developer (with aspirations for full stack). This passion started to bloom 2 years ago.</p>
                <p>I come from a little city called Constanta, which is in Romania. Curently, I'm living in Bucharest. I like to create something beautiful looking, using my imagination but as much as I try to balance everything, I prefer functionality over estetics.</p>
                <p>Other things that I keep close to my heart are chill walks, running and cooking with way too many spices(what's the ballance between enough pepper and way too much? I don't know!)</p>
                <p>Now that you know something about me, you can view my <a href="#" class="btn nav-btn" data-target-class="projects-page">recent projects</a>, <a href="#" class="btn nav-btn" data-target-class="education-page">check my education and aspirations</a>,<a href="#" class="btn nav-btn" data-target-class="contact-page">contact me</a> or return to <a href="#" class="btn nav-btn" data-target-class="home-page">home page</a>.</p>

                <p>My education is..a long story</p>
                <p>After finishing High School, I had no ideea what career would make me happy. I rushed into Communication & PR at SNSPA because of peer pressure, and for a while it was what I wanted. I dropped out, on last year of university, after I had a internship and my fears were confirmed: It's not for me.  PR & HR will remain a domain of interest for me, but not something that I would happly do for a loooong time.</p>
                <p>From that moment, I decided I will do what I always knew I had a deep real passion and since playing with tiger cubs or scuba diving with dolphins was not a valid option, all I had left was...coding. I don't know why it makes me so happy to create something out of thin <del>air</del> keys, but it does, and I love it.</p>
               <p>At first I graduated a course wich put the base of my <a  class="btn " target="_blank"  href="https://www.digitalskills.ro/cursuri/web-design">html&css</a>  knowledge, even got a ANC accreditation for "webpages designer". After that I wanted something a little bit more challenging, so I enrolled at "Web Development(Javascript)" course from <a  class="btn" target="_blank"  href="https://scoalainformala.ro/program/web-dev-javascript-bucuresti/">"Scoala Informala de IT"</a> and after all the white hairs that JS gave me, I graduated with another ANC certificate, this time for "developer help(ajutor de programator)"</p>
                <p>In the future I want to finish a few more courses: PHP, Phyton, Angular6, MySQL & anything interesting that will appear in the future. And maybe attend a <a  class="btn"target="_blank"  href="https://www.ucn.dk/english/programmes-and-courses/web-development"> univeristy in Denmark.</a> I want to swim in diplomas and maybe I'll eventually dye my hair gray from all the sleepless nights I'll have from learning how to be a better coder.</p>
               <p>Now that you know something about my educational future & background , you can view my <a href="#" class="btn nav-btn" data-target-class="projects-page">recent projects</a>, <a href="#" class="btn nav-btn" data-target-class="contact-page">contact me</a> or return to <a href="#" class="btn nav-btn" data-target-class="home-page">home page</a>.</p>

                <p>Here you will find my most recent projects.</p>
                <p>My last project was a<a href="https://mihaelahincu.github.io/Restaurant/" class="btn">Restaurant website</a>.I keep this project close to my heart. I tried many things from A to Z with this project, from the theme to the way I wrote the code. I took my time and updated it constantly, everytime I learned something new. This project is my lab-rat, I even tried to learn Angular2 while building it up. </p>
                <p>The other project i want to tell you about is <a href="https://mihaelahincu.github.io/Projects/BabyBear/index.html " class="btn">"BabyBear" website</a>. This virtual shop was built with the ideea of selling a variety of baby items, and it's also the final project for the Web Development course. This is my very first projects wich uses javascript, it's not very detailed, but I think it's a good way of measuring my progress. I feel proud of it now, but in a few years I'll laugh about the code I wrote. Learning to code, one project at a time!</p>
                <p>And the last project is <a href="https://mihaelahincu.github.io/flowershop/index.html" class="btn">A flowershop website</a>This is my first Vue.js project, it was a joy to learn my first framework. I used a basic html&css base, and modified it with vue's particularities.</p>
